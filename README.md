# 👋 Hey there, I'm Ramon

🛠 **Software Engineer** | 🧪 **React & JavaScript Specialist** | 🌐 **Freelancer**


🌱 With over **10 years** of experience, I've navigated the vast landscape of web development, getting hands-on with the core elements of React and the practical facets of JavaScript. I am deeply passionate about exploring new technologies, sharing my knowledge, and assisting others in their tech journey.

🚀 **Things I love**: 
- Crafting applications with **JavaScript** & **React**
- Mentoring & teaching the wonders of coding
- Venturing into new tech territories and pushing boundaries

🔍 **Code Philosophy**: "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

🎮 **Fun Fact**: Once a pro gamer, now I’m pretty sure game devs sneakily upped the difficulty when I wasn't looking.
